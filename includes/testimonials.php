                    <p>"I must say that my experience with Zach the project manager and his team was terrific. They guided me along in the editing and process and were not only helpful but patient. Zach was a personal pleasure to deal with. I also learned along the way and was able to even improve upon my own writing and punctuation. He was always responsive to my questions and problems." </p>

                    <p>“Kudos to the amazing team and for sure the people behind it. I've been struggling to publish for years and on a fine October morning I call <?php echo WEBSITE_NAME; ?> and get connected to Eddie Williams. Since then they have made my dream possible and thank you Zach for being available throughout the entire process, and whatever of an issue I'd, he responded me with patience and dedication. I felt heard and I'm glad my book "An Art of Love" is out there and seeking your love for the same!” </p>

                    <h4>Excellent understanding of what works for formatting & publishing.
                    </h4>
                    <p>"I created a children's book and considered it to publish as self-publishing by KDP. But it's a debut book, and I worried it doesn't look professional because of poor formatting, so contact <?php echo WEBSITE_NAME; ?>. Most of all, Mr. Walton Pierce is an excellent manager. He helped to publish them one by one as if he is a personal coach. Thank you so much!"</p>

We had a few miss communications and some editing problems but in the end the book is just as I had hoped. Eddie was always courteous, patient and ready to help with all the issues this first time publisher had. Thanks!" </p>
